                        Every year, we celebrate Vintage Car Rally Race which can be categorized into two parts: Rally Across the Town Event and People Voting Event. Rally Across the Town event performs on every 1st November in England and every racer drive approximately 600 kilometers from London to Brighton with about 10 special stages. Usually participants take part in a rally in pairs, a driver who drives and a co-driver who assists the driver. Co-drivers play an important role such as navigating or time management in a competition, so that drivers can concentrate on driving.

                        Our organization supports a great family of classic car enthusiasts who want to show their design idea and historic vehicles. During Rally Event, they can post their classic cars on this website with specific details like name, location and phone number. People who are registered in this website, except the racers, are able to vote only one vintage car that they would like to support. A classic car rally is a race where participants follow the traffic rules and can enjoy driving with their beloved car, and at the same time it entertains the eyes of roadside spectators.

                        In a competition, participants compete for how actually they can drive in a designated section at a set of time, the skills to handle their classic car and how they can follow the traffic rules. In addition, unless participants receive a stamp at all points set on the route as proof of passing and complete the rally, they won't be eligible for the prizes. And one more thing, an undisclosed checkpoint is set on the route and participants are checked if they violate the traffic rules. This is called Secret Checkpoint (SCP) and if they violate the rules, their points will be deducted.
